# MongoDB updateOne Method Error: Incorrect Filter

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `updateOne` method in MongoDB's Node.js driver. The error stems from incorrectly specifying the filter and update parameters, leading to unintended updates on all documents in a collection. 

## Problem

The provided `bug.js` file shows how using an empty filter object `{}` in `collection.updateOne({}, {$set: {field1: 'value1'}})` causes the update operation to modify *all* documents within the specified collection by setting `field1` to `value1`, instead of targeting a specific document. 

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file offers a corrected approach.  The solution specifies a proper filter to select a specific document (e.g., based on an `_id` field) before performing the update. This ensures only the target document undergoes modification, preventing unintended side effects and maintaining data integrity.
